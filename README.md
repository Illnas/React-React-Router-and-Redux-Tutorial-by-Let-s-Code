React, React Router and Redux Tutorial by Lets Code

So another tutorial in which I wanted to see, and do, another example of
using Redux. 
So far, it has the same way they create store, create actions and reducers.
And I am on boat for using Redux!

What is left at this moment is, going through Redux basics by Lets Code, 
and doing tutorial by Ben Awad in which he introduces every React Hook.
Which is going to be SOOOO helpful! Especially since I am already at a
stage where I am comftorable with useState. 

Anyway, that is left for tomorrow.
